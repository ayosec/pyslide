-------------------------------------------

You can install the program using distutils. For example, with

    $ python setup.py install --prefix=/some/dir

you will install both Pyslide modules and the pyslide script. After a correct
installation, you could start the presentations with

    $ PYTHONPATH=/some/dir/lib/pythonN.N/site-packages/ /some/dir/pyslide file.xml

or with

    $ pyslide file.xml

if you install the package in the defaults directories.

Note that you don't need to install the program to run it, since it
can be executed from the source directory.

See the examples in the distribution.

 XML Language: A brief description
-----------------------------------

 N.B.: This description is out of date.

This is a very brief (and not very good :-( ) description of the XML
language used by Pyslide.

It is very easy to write presentations for Pyslide. There are seven
tags: presentation, page, group, text, image, shape and system.

 - presentation
   ============
   This is the root tag for the file. Its attributes affect to the
   full presentation.
   
   Possible attributes are:

    caption  The caption of the window 
    size     The size (WIDTHxHEIGHT) of the screen/window
    bg       An image to use as the default background
    bgcolor  A color to use as the default background

   See below for info about colors.
    
 - page
   ====
   Every page in the presentation is defined py a <page> tag.

   Possible attributes are:

    bg      Background image
    bgcolor Background color
    bggrad  Background gradient.
    bgscale If you set an image with "bg", you can control
            if it is scaled or not. This attribute can be
            "yes" or "no". By default, it is "yes".
    ttl     Max time (in tenth of second) that the page can
            exists. After that time, if the page is still 
            viewed, it will closed.

 - group
   =====
   A group contain a list of items. All the items in a group
   are showed with the group, but not all the groups in a page
   are showed at the same time. To see all the groups in a page,
   you have to open it with <SPACE> or <RIGHT> keys.

   A group doesn't have attributes, but in the XML you can put 
   attributes in the <group> tag and those attributes will be set 
   to all its items.

 - text and image
   ==============
   Those tags are used to put a text or an image in the page. For text,
   the content to show is put between <text> and </text>. For images,
   you put the path of the image in the src attribute, as 
   <image src="foo.png"/>.

   Common attributes (to both images and texts):

    xy      The x,y position of the item
    x       The x position. Doesn't change the y value. If you start
            the value with a '+' or with a '-', the value will be added
            or reduced with the current X. This is useful if you want to
            positionate an item relative to its previous item.
    y       As "x", with the axis Y
    ttl     Time to leave (in tenth of second). It can be "none".
    wait    Time to wait before the item starts. It can be "none".
    open-effect-N
    close-effect-N
            Load the effect N. See below for information about effects.
    keep-always
            The item never dies. It is always showed in all pages.
    list    Set a "list image". See below for more information about
            lists.
    align   Aligns an item. It can be "left", "center" or "right".

   Attributes for texts

    color       Text color.
    shadow      Shadow color. It can be "none".
    font-size   Size of the font. Defaults to 60.
    font-file   Loads a font from a file. The file has to be TTF or
                FON 
    interspace  Set the space betwen lines of text. 

   Attributes for images

    src     Path of the image to load
    size    Size of the image. By default, it is the same size
            of the image.

 - shape
   =====

   Pyslide is able to draw some shapes (really, the shapes are drawn
   by pygame :-) ). You select a shape with the "shape" attribute. The
   other attributes depend on the shape, except "color", which has the
   same meaning.

   The shape available are line, circle, rect and polygon.

   * line
      Attributes:
        width   line width
        start   start point
        end     end point

      If width is not given, it will be 1 pixel (independently of the
      size of the canvas)

   * circle
      Attributes:
        width   Width of the line
        center  center point
        radius  radius

      If width is not given, or it is zero, the circle will be filled

   * rect
      Attributes:
        width   line width
        start   top-left corner
        end     bottom-right corner

      if width is not given, or it is zer, the rect will be filled.

   * polygon
      Attributes:
        width   line width
        points  List of points, separeted by a semicolon (';')


   For example, the following tags will generate the same shapes, but in
   different places

    <shape shape="rect" color="red" width="10" start="10,10" end="990,150"/>

    <shape shape="polygon" color="green" width="10"
       points="10,210;990,210;990,350;10,350;10,210"/>

    <shape shape="line" width="10" color="blue" start="10,400" end="990,400"/>
    <shape shape="line" width="10" color="blue" start="990,400" end="990,540"/>
    <shape shape="line" width="10" color="blue" start="990,540" end="10,540"/>
    <shape shape="line" width="10" color="blue" start="10,540" end="10,400"/>


 - system
   ======

   With this tag you can execute external programs. There is two
   attributes for <system>:

    cmd     The command line to execute. This is executed with "/bin/sh -c"
    method  This can be "read" or "start". See below for more
            information about this.

Units
-----

All the units in the pages are proportionals. That is, Pyslide use a
virtual surface, which size is 1000x750, and scale all the units using

 x = (x * W) / 1000
 y = (y * H) / 750

W and H are the dimensions (width and height) of the window. If you
change the width and height values of the presentation, all the items
will scale to keep the proportions.

Image size
----------

You can change the image of a size using the size attribute for
<image>. The format is "new_width,new_height". If you put a value
smaller than 10, the value will be multiplied by the dimension. For
example, for an image with size 100x100

 1,1 == 100,100
 1,2 == 100,200
 4,4 == 400,400
 ...

NOTE: As normal units, the image will be scaled only if you set the
size attribute. That is, if you don't put it in the <image> tag, the
image won't be scaled. If you want to scale the image use size 1,1.
For example

  <image size="1,1" xy="100,100" src="some.png"/>


Colors and gradients
--------------------

The program is very flexible with the colores. You can choose a color
with its R,G,B form, or with a name. The available colors are listed
in the pygame.colordict module. You can see them with 

$ python -c 'import pygame.colordict as d; print "\n".join(d.THECOLORS.keys())'

If you set the color with values, you have to separete red-green-blue
values with commas. For example, to set red 100, green 200 and blue
60, use "100,200,60".

Gradients are set with two color separated by a dash. You can use both
names and values. For example, the next gradients are equivalent

"white-black"
"white-0,0,0"
"255,255,255-black"
"255,255,255-0,0,0"


Effects
-------

There is two kind of effects: open-effects and close-effects.
open-effects starts when the item is showed, and close-effects starts
when the item is going to be killed. A close-effect does not start if
not all the open-effects has been finished.

You set an effect with open-effect-NAME and close-effect-NAME. At this
moment, NAME can be either "alpha", "halpha", "valpha" and "move". The
attribute value is the effect parameters.

The "move" parameter is "x,y,t" trio. x and y are the distance to the
item. For an open-effect, x,y is distance where the item will start.
For a close-effect, x,y is the distance where the item will be killed.
The last argument, t, is the time (in tenth of second) that the effect
will be running.

The "alpha", "halpha" and "valpha" parameter is the time that the
effect will be running. For "valpha" and "halpha" effects you can put
a negative time, this means that the effect will be from bottom to
top.

CSS
---

You can put any thing that you want in it. To put CSS code, use the
<style> tag. For instance, to create a class

    <style>
        .title {
            font-size: 100;
            color: red;
            xy: 10,10
        }
    </style>

    <text class="title">I am a title</text>

If you want to load a CSS file, you can use the source attribute:

    <style source="some_file.css"/>


There is a very useful feature: you can create your own tags with CSS.
You only need to write them without a dot, and put in its attributes
the item-type attribute. item-type tells Pyslide what kind of item if
it. For example, to create a <list> tag, you can do something like

    list {
        item-type: text;
        for-first-x: +100;
        list: rhombus;
    }

    title {
        item-type: text;
        xy: 100,200;
        font-size: 100;
    }

And now, in the XML, you can put

    <group>
        <title>List title</title>
        <list>First element</list>
        <list>second</list>
        <list>...</list>
    </group>


Conditional attributes
----------------------

You can control when apply an attribute or not, according to its
position. This is very useful when you are creating tags or classes
with CSS.

To control the position, you have to start the attribute name with
"for-<position>-", where position can be "first", "second", "third",
"odd", "even" or a nunmber. For example

for-first-x: 100;       Apply "x: 100" only to the first element
for-odd-color: blue;    Apply "color: blue" only to odd elements.
for-10-list: circle;    Apply "list: circle" only to the 10th element.

Note that the position is incremented when a tag is repeated. When a
tag with a different name appears, its position is reset. That is, if
you put something like

    <title>...</title>      First position
    <list>...</list>        First position
    <list>...</list>        Second position
    <list>...</list>        Third position
    <text>...</text>        First position
    <list>...</list>        First position, again


And, with something like

    <image />
    <text> </text>
    <list> </list>
    <shape />
    <text> </text>

All of them will be at first position, because there are no several
consecutive equal labels

Lists
-----

At this moment, there are not real list. But, if you need to put a
little symbol close to the item, you can use the "list" attribute.

This is a tricky, and this would have to be better, but this is a
quick solution, and.. it works :-)

There is three symbols: rhombus, circles and squares:

    <text list="circle">Circle</text>
    <text list="square">Square</text>
    <text list="rhombus">Rhombus</text>


Executing programs
------------------

You can execute external programs with the <system> tag. You have to
set both "cmd" and "method" attributes, altought you can set more
attributes if you use the "read" method.

 N.B.:

    Obviously, execute external programs is not always secure. You
    can, for example, download a presentation and try to execute it.
    If you don't know what the presentation does, you probably want to
    avoid execute commands

    For this reason, Pyslide has a special mode called «unsecure». If
    you want to use the <system> tag, you have to start Pyslide in
    this mode, with the -u option. For example,

        $ pyslide -u file.xml

    Unless -u is used, pyslide will refuse to load a presentation
    which has a <system> tag.

The "cmd" attribute says to Pyslide which command execute. This string
is passed directly to /bin/sh, so you can use the shell syntax.

The "method" attribute says to Pyslide how execute the program. It can
be "read" or "start".

If method is "read", the program will be executed when the page is
created, and Pyslide will read its output (stdout) and create a text
item with it. If you put more attributes than "method" and "cmd" in
the <system> tag, those attributes will be passed to the new item. For
example, you can put something like

    <system method="read" cmd="uname -a" color="green"/>

If method is "start", the program will be executed in background.
