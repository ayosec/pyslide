Description: Tiny but powerful program to make animated presentations
 Pyslide allows you to make presentations with text, images and shapes, loads
 different fonts from TTF files, animate them and make a variety of alpha
 effects.

 There is a brief description of the syntax in the README file and some examples
 in the distribution, where all the features are shown.

 It is written in Python and uses SDL (through pygame), the presentations are
 created in an XML file and can be compiled into Python code.

 You need the Python Image Library to export the presentation to static web
 pages.
